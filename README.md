# Coral Bleaching Classification Using Machine Learning

This project explores multiple machine learning methods to classify coral images as **healthy** or **bleached**. Our goal is to develop accurate, efficient, and accessible models that can assist in large-scale coral reef monitoring, particularly in resource-constrained field conditions.

## Project Overview

Coral reefs play a vital ecological and cultural role, especially in Hawai ªi. However, with increasing global temperatures, **coral bleaching** is a growing threat. Traditional monitoring methods are manual and slow. In this project, we compare three different machine learning approaches for automating coral health classification:

- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** ‚Äì deep learning baseline
- **KNN with Color Feature Extraction** ‚Äì novel lightweight approach
- **Gradient Boosting with Feature Engineering** ‚Äì structured ML solution

Our models were trained on a dataset of over 9,900 labeled coral images provided by NOAA. All code and feature extraction pipelines are included in this repository.
